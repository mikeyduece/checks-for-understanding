1. What's your favorite project management tool?
>Waffle, bc of its integration with github.
2. Why do we create staging environments?
>So can test our code in different environments to ensure that it works as intended.
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
>Well detailed on how to use the app. Steps on setup, examples of code showing usage for most commom parts.
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
>Alt images and tab index. My mouse broke down over the break on my desktop computer and the app
that I was using was not tab accessible. I have a new found respect for not being able to use a mouse.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
>Man in the middle attacks such as replaying.
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?

it ensures that the same steps are done each time.
7. What are some pros/cons of using ReactJS as a frontend tool?
Pros - fast, SPA.
Con - The maintainers on github issues seem to be pretty mean.
#### Review

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
>Pull from master regularly, merge master into your branch, fix any merge conflicts, make your additions and then push branch
to repo, submit PR.
9. Describe each of the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming.
>Abstraction- Break long pieces of code into smaller pieces that adhere to SRP
>Encapsulation- Put methods that pertain to the same thing into their own classes.
>Inheritance- Use the methods from one class/gem in another
>Polymorphism- he ability to use functions or methods in different ways for different objects or data types.
10. What's a module in Ruby? What's the difference between a class and a module? What are some good use cases for modules?
>Module handles behavior, not state. SO if a method doesn't hold state and just parses information.
